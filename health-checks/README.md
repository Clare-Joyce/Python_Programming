# health-checks
Use for scripts that check the health of my computer.

This repository will be populated with lots of fancy checks.

Currently, the main script name is `all_checks.py`.

The scripts will:
* check the disk space
* check for space in the root partition
* check CPU load
* check any pending reboots
* check for network connectivity

The script prints "Everything ok" if all checks pass and corresponding message if any check fails.
